                <h3>Why should I use Flipup?</h3>
                <p>Flipup is a quiz site with more of a focus on learning and revision than other quiz sites that have been made. This site aims to give you the ability to take quizzes designed by other people or set up your own set of questions to test yourself on what you have learned. Of course, Flipup can also be used for fun</p>
                <h3> How do I create my own quizzes? </h3>
                <p> To create your own quiz, first make sure you are signed onto the site then click "Create" in the header bar. Then, give your deck of questions a name and a subject. This will then take you onto the question editing page where you can add and edit your questions. A deck requires a minimum of 10 questions. </p>
                <h3> How do I register?</h3>
                <p>Click sign up in the header bar, then in the webpage that opens, fill in your chosen username and password. If the username is available you will then have created an account.</p>
                <h3> How can I find a quiz I want to take? </h3>
                <p>On the main page there are a list of currently trending quizzes and subjects. To find a quiz on a particular subject click on one of the subjects and from the list that appears, click on the quiz you would like to take.</p>
                <h3> How many questions are there in a quiz? </h3>
                <p>You can choose how many questions you would like to take in a quiz, however, most decks will only have 10 questions so this is the max number you can take in any given quiz, if you want a quiz of fewer questions than this, random questions will be chosen from the deck for your quiz.</p>
