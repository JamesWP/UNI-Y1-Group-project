          <p>Accessing websites is a good way to keep in touch with the society and acquire some knowledge. People can create anything they want like text, images and other elements and potentially share thousands of opinions around the world, so there are some ethical issues appeared. Whether you realize it or not, they must take responsibility for these.</p>
          <p>For example, In our website "Flip up", we create a system which lets people take a quiz made up a few of the questions in our database, or simply add their own in order to improve the existing sections. However, in order to avoid any law or ethical issues, so both the user and us, the developers, should have responsibilities:</p>
